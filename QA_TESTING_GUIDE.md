# QA Testing Guide: Season-Long Balance Tracking

## üéØ Testing Objectives
Verify that the lineup generator now considers cumulative stats from previous games to ensure fair distribution across the entire season.

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Fresh Start (Baseline)**
**Setup:**
- Clear browser data or use incognito mode
- Enter team code (e.g., "test")
- Add 10 players to roster

**Steps:**
1. Generate Game 1 lineup
2. Note which players get which positions
3. Check season stats (should all be zero initially)

**Expected Result:**
- Lineup generates normally
- Season stats show zero for all players
- All players get fair distribution within Game 1

---

### **Test 2: Second Game (Cumulative Balance)**
**Setup:**
- Same 10 players from Test 1
- Game 1 already generated

**Steps:**
1. Generate Game 2 lineup
2. Compare with Game 1 positions
3. Check season stats

**Expected Result:**
- Players who got less playing time in Game 1 should get priority in Game 2
- Season stats should show cumulative totals from both games
- Overall balance should improve across the two games

---

### **Test 3: Position Balance Over Time**
**Setup:**
- Same 10 players
- Generate 3-4 games

**Steps:**
1. Generate Game 3 lineup
2. Generate Game 4 lineup
3. Review cumulative position distribution

**Expected Result:**
- Infield/outfield/pitching time should balance across all games
- No player consistently gets the same position
- Cumulative stats show fair distribution

---

### **Test 4: Bench Time Balance**
**Setup:**
- Add 12+ players to roster (creates bench time)
- Generate multiple games

**Steps:**
1. Generate several games
2. Track which players get benched
3. Check if benched players get priority in future games

**Expected Result:**
- Players who were benched more should get priority for playing time
- Bench time should balance across the season
- No player consistently sits out

---

### **Test 5: Missed Games (Should Not Count)**
**Setup:**
- 10 players in roster
- Generate Game 1 with all players
- Generate Game 2 with only 8 players (2 miss the game)

**Steps:**
1. Generate Game 1 lineup (all 10 players)
2. Generate Game 2 lineup (only 8 players available)
3. Check season stats

**Expected Result:**
- Missed players should NOT have their stats penalized
- Only players who actually played should have their stats updated
- Game 3 should treat all players fairly based on actual participation

## üîç How to Check Season Stats

### **Method 1: Browser Console**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: `console.log(seasonStats)`
4. Review the cumulative stats for each player

### **Method 2: Local Storage**
1. Open developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Look for `lineupBuilder_[teamcode]_seasonStats`
4. View the JSON data

### **Method 3: Lineup Analysis**
1. Generate multiple games
2. Review the lineup statistics table
3. Check if cumulative balance improves over time

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### **Issue 1: Season Stats Not Updating**
- **Symptom:** Stats remain zero after generating lineups
- **Check:** Console for errors, localStorage for data

- **Symptom:** Same players get same positions every game
- **Check:** Priority calculation, season stats loading

### **Issue 3: Missed Games Counted**
- **Symptom:** Players who miss games have negative stats
- **Check:** Available players logic, stats update logic

### **Issue 4: Browser Data Issues**
- **Symptom:** Stats don't persist between sessions
- **Check:** localStorage, team code, data saving
