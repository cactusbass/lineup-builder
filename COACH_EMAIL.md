# Email to Coaches - Lineup Builder Tool

**Subject:** Quick lineup management tool - would love your feedback!

Hi fellow coaches,

I hope this finds you well! I wanted to share something I've been working on that might be helpful for managing lineups and keeping things fair for the kids.

## The Problem I Was Trying to Solve

Like many of you, I was getting frustrated trying to manually create balanced lineups that give every kid fair playing time. Between tracking who's pitched how many innings, making sure catchers get proper rest, balancing infield/outfield time, and managing bench rotation - it was becoming a real headache. I found myself spending way too much time on lineup management instead of focusing on coaching.

## What I Built

So I built a simple web tool that automates the lineup generation process. It's nothing fancy - just a way to input your players, schedule games, and let the algorithm handle the position rotations while keeping things fair.

**Key features:**
- Automatic defensive lineup generation with fair playing time
- Drag-and-drop batting order creation
- Comprehensive statistics to verify balance
- Print-ready lineup cards
- Team code system so each coach has their own data

## The Algorithm is Transparent

Here's what I think makes this different - you can see exactly how the algorithm works. Every coach has different preferences and philosophies, so I've made all the rules and constraints visible in the app. You can see the logic behind pitcher rotation, catching rules, playing time balance, and bench management. If you disagree with how I've set it up, you'll at least know what it's doing and why.

## It's Still a Work in Progress

This started as a personal project to solve my own frustration, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to others. I'm sure there are things I've missed or gotten wrong, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**What I'm looking for:**
- Does this actually solve a real problem for you?
- What features are missing that would make it more useful?
- Are there different rules or constraints you'd want to see?
- Any bugs or issues you run into?

## How to Try It

The tool is available at: **https://cactusbass.github.io/lineup-builder/**

You'll need to enter a team code (just make one up - like "thunderbolts" or your team name). I've attached a quick start guide with more details.

## No Pressure

This is just me trying to solve a real problem I was having. If it's not useful to you, no worries at all. If it is helpful, great! And if you have ideas for making it better, I'd genuinely love to hear them.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out, and good luck with your season!

Best,
[Your name]
